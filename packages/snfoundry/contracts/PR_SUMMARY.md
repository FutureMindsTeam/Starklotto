## 📌 Description 
This PR implements comprehensive unit tests for the `buyTicket()` smart contract function in the StarkLotto project, achieving **100% coverage** of all specified requirements. The implementation includes 12 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality, validation scenarios, edge cases, and security considerations. All tests are passing with clean code (no warnings) and optimized performance.

## 🎯 Motivation and Context 
The buyTicket() function is a critical component of the lottery smart contract that handles user ticket purchases, number validation, draw state management, and payment processing. Without comprehensive testing, this function poses significant risks including potential exploits, edge case failures, and undetected bugs in production. This change is necessary to ensure robust validation of critical lottery functionality and provide confidence for production deployment.

**Key Problems Solved:**
- ✅ No existing unit tests for buyTicket() function
- ✅ Risk of undetected bugs in critical lottery functionality  
- ✅ Lack of validation for edge cases and security scenarios
- ✅ No documentation for testing procedures
- ✅ Framework compatibility issues (updated snforge_std v0.34.0 → v0.44.0)

Closes #193

## 🛠️ How to Test the Change (if applicable) 
Describe the steps to test your changes:
1. 🔹 **Navigate to contracts directory**: `cd packages/snfoundry/contracts`
2. 🔹 **Run all tests**: `snforge test` (should show 12 passed, 0 failed)
3. 🔹 **Run with detailed output**: `snforge test --detailed-resources` (shows gas usage metrics)
4. 🔹 **Run specific test**: `snforge test test_buy_ticket_valid_numbers` (tests number validation)
5. 🔹 **Verify test coverage**: All 6 core requirements from issue #193 are covered
6. 🔹 **Check code quality**: No warnings in test files, clean compilation

**Expected Results:**
```
✅ Tests: 12 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
✅ All buyTicket() requirements covered
✅ Framework: Fully operational
✅ Ready for production use
```
